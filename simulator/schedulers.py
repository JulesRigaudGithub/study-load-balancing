"""Module containing scheduling algorithms.

Each scheduling algorithm receives a specific set of inputs and
outputs a mapping.

Implemented scheduling methods: round_robin, compact, uniformly_random,
list_scheduler.
Methods with interfaces but no implementation: lpt, lpt_with_limits,
list_scheduler_for_uniform_resources.
